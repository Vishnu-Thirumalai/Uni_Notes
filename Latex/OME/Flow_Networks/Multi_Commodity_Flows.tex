\subsection{Multi\_Commodity Flows}
These problems have a single flow network with \textbf{multiple types of flows} running simultaneously. Each type of flow (commodity) has its own source and sink (some networks might have multiple sources/sinks in a single node), and a demand to be fulfilled. Each commodity is represented as \textbf{(source (node), sink (node), demand (real value))}.\\ \\
Problems are to find a simultaneous flow of multiple commodities to solve a global objective. The overall flow is composed of multiple sub-flows, each of which represents one commodity. All other flow rules are followed, though some problems don't account for capacity/have separate capacities for each commodity.

\subsubsection{Types of Problems}\label{subsubsec:Multi_Commodity_Problem_Types}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Feasibility: find a flow that satisfies edge capacities and commodity demands.
    \item Minimum-cost: find a flow that satisfies edge capacities, gets as close to commodity demands as possible, while having a minimum cost
    \item Minimum-Congestion: Find a flow that satisfies demands while minimising the maximum edge congestion across the graph
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Congestion(a,b) = $\frac{flow(a,b)}{capacity(a,b)}$
        \item The solution might break feasibility. i.e max. congestion might be $>1$
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
